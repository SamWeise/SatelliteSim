# SatelliteSim
This repository consists of projects associated with designing a satellite test bed.

The current repository contains an implementation of a star object to associate with stars in the heavens, a star catalog to identify stars by their right ascension, declination, and magnitude, an environment object to configure the satellite's mission time and rotational period, and a star sensor to track the position of the satellite in its orbit by identifying which stars it sees at its current orbit time and rotation time.
